This prototype for my global climate change proposal is written using Python, Jinja2, Flask-SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL. The system proposal, design and prototype are available to use in whole or in part. It's designed to connect individuals, communities, scientists, advocates and policy makers with sustainable systems/initiatives/organizations (and each other) at home and around the world. Daily climate change news and CO2 emission counts/air quality indices by location(s) enable all to stay informed, participate, communicate, combine efforts and track progress so that as global citizens we can move the needle together!
